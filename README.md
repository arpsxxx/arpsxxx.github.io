## 🔒 Security Best Practices

This portfolio implements **frontend security best practices**, including:

- **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Restricts sources for scripts, styles, and media  
- **Safe External Links:** All links with `target="_blank"` include `rel="noopener noreferrer"`  
- **Security Meta Tags:** `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, and `referrer` policies  
- **Clean separation of concerns:** All scripts and styles loaded externally; no inline JS or styles  

These measures ensure the website is **secure, maintainable, and professional**.
